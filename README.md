# Welcome to Planify your project management app ðŸ‘‹

Thhis is the frontend of your project management application, developed with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) and [Expo](https://expo.dev). The backend of this application is available on GitHub at the following link: [Backend - mn.to-do-list](https://github.com/MN-Sandratra/mn.to-do-list).

## Get started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MN-Sandratra/Planify.git
   cd YOUR-REPO-NAME
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Backend

The backend for this project is hosted separately. You can find the backend repository on GitHub:

- [Backend - nestjs-planify](https://github.com/MN-Sandratra/mn.to-do-list)

This backend provides the necessary APIs and database interactions required for the project management app to function.
